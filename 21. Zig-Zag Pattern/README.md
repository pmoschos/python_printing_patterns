# ⭐ Python Zigzag Pattern Function Demonstration ⭐

Welcome to the Python Zigzag Pattern Function Demonstration! This script showcases a function that prints a zigzag pattern of stars based on a given number of columns. It's an excellent resource for anyone learning Python or those teaching programming concepts related to loops, conditional logic, and pattern generation.

## Script Overview 📘

The script includes a function called `zigzag_pattern` which takes an integer `n` and prints a zigzag pattern with `n` columns. The script demonstrates how to use nested loops to generate and format the output in a zigzag manner.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
def zigzag_pattern(n):
    for i in range(1, 4):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if ((i + j) % 4 == 0) or (i == 2 and j % 4 == 0):
                print("*", end="")
            else:
                print(" ", end="")
        print()

def main():
    n = int(input("Please give me a integer: "))
    zigzag_pattern(n)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

# Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

# Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `zigzag_pattern.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `zigzag_pattern.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python zigzag_pattern.py`.

# Usage Example 📋
Execute the script, input an integer value when prompted, and see how the function generates a zigzag pattern with the specified number of columns. This will help you understand the practical applications of nested loops, formatted string output, and pattern generation in Python programming.
