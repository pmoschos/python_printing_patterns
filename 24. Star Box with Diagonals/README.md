# ⭐ Python Star Box with Diagonals Pattern Function Demonstration ⭐

Welcome to the Python Star Box with Diagonals Pattern Function Demonstration! This script showcases a function that prints a star box with diagonals pattern based on a given number of rows and columns. It's an excellent resource for anyone learning Python or those teaching programming concepts related to loops, conditional logic, and pattern generation.

## Script Overview 📘

The script includes a function called `star_box_with_diagonals` which takes an integer `n` and prints a star box with diagonals pattern with `n` rows and `n` columns. The script demonstrates how to use nested loops to generate and format the output.

### :computer: Script Code

```python
def star_box_with_diagonals(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 or i == n - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1 or i == j or i + j == n - 1:
                print("*", end="")
            else:
                print(" ", end="")
        print()

def main():
    n = int(input("Please give me a integer: "))
    star_box_with_diagonals(n)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

# Key Features 🌟
- **Looping Constructs**: Learn how to use nested loops to create complex patterns and shapes.
- **Conditional Logic**: Understand how to implement conditional checks within loops to handle different scenarios effectively.
- **Pattern Generation**: Learn how to generate and print structured patterns in a star box with diagonals manner.

# Console Output Example 📋
When you run the script and input 7, the console output will be:

```python
      *      
     * *     
    *   *    
   *     *   
  *       *  
 *         * 
*************
```

# Technical Requirements 🔧
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

# Installation and Setup 🚀
No installation is required, as the script can be run directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `star_box_with_diagonals.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `star_box_with_diagonals.py`.
5. Run the script with: `python star_box_with_diagonals.py`.

# Usage Example 📋
Execute the script, input an integer value when prompted, and see how the function generates a star box with diagonals pattern with the specified number of rows and columns. This will help you understand the practical applications of nested loops, formatted string output, and pattern generation in Python programming.
